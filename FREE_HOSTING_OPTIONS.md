## 🆓 **Completely Free Options:**

### 1. **Railway** ⭐ **BEST FREE OPTION**
- **Free Tier:** $5 credit per month (usually enough for small apps)
- **Limits:** 500 hours/month, 1GB RAM
- **Perfect for:** Waitlist with moderate traffic
- **Pros:** Modern, easy setup, great free tier
- **Cons:** Credit-based (but $5/month is generous)

```bash

./deploy.sh
# Choose option 3 (Railway)
```

### 2. **Render** ⭐ **TRULY FREE**
- **Free Tier:** Completely free forever
- **Limits:** Sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Perfect for:** Low-traffic waitlist
- **Pros:** Actually free, no credit card required
- **Cons:** Cold starts (slow first load after sleep)

```bash

# 2. Set environment variables
# 3. Deploy automatically
```

### 3. **Heroku** ❌ **NO LONGER FREE**
- **Used to be free** but discontinued free tier in 2022
- **Now costs:** $7/month minimum
- **Skip this option** for free hosting

### 4. **Vercel (Serverless Functions)** ⭐ **FREE WITH LIMITS**
- **Free Tier:** 100GB bandwidth, 100 serverless function invocations/day
- **Limits:** Function timeout, cold starts
- **Perfect for:** Low-traffic waitlist
- **Pros:** Great performance, easy deployment
- **Cons:** More complex setup for full backend

## 🎯 **My Recommendations:**

### **For Your Waitlist (Best to Worst):**

1. **🥇 Railway** - $5 credit/month (effectively free for small apps)
2. **🥈 Render** - Completely free but sleeps when inactive  
3. **🥉 Vercel Functions** - Free but requires code changes

## 📊 **Detailed Comparison:**

| Platform | Cost | Uptime | Setup Difficulty | Best For |
|----------|------|--------|------------------|----------|
| **Railway** | $5 credit/month | 24/7 | Easy | Small-medium traffic |
| **Render** | Free forever | Sleeps after 15min | Easy | Low traffic |
| **Vercel** | Free (with limits) | 24/7 | Medium | Tech-savvy users |

## 🚀 **Quick Setup Instructions:**

### **Option 1: Railway (Recommended)**
```bash
cd docs/waitlist
./deploy.sh
# Choose option 3
# Sign up with GitHub
# Get $5 monthly credit (enough for waitlist)
```

### **Option 2: Render (Truly Free)**
```bash
# 1. Go to render.com
# 2. Connect your GitHub repo
# 3. Choose "Web Service"
# 4. Set build command: npm install
# 5. Set start command: npm start
# 6. Add environment variables:
#    ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-password
#    NODE_ENV=production
```

### **Option 3: Vercel Functions**
```bash
# Requires converting backend to serverless functions
# More complex but very reliable
```

## ⚡ **What "Sleeps" Means (Render):**

- **Active use:** Fast, normal response times
- **15 minutes idle:** Server goes to sleep
- **Next visitor:** 30-60 second delay to wake up
- **Then:** Normal speed again

**For a waitlist, this is usually fine!** Most people won't notice the occasional slow load.

## 💡 **My Specific Recommendation for You:**

### **Start with Railway:**
- $5 credit is effectively free for a waitlist
- No sleep issues
- Easy deployment
- Professional performance

### **If you want truly free:**
- Use Render
- Accept the occasional slow load
- Still works perfectly for collecting signups

## 🧪 **Test Both Options:**

You can deploy to both and see which you prefer:

```bash
# Deploy to Railway
./deploy.sh  # Choose option 3

# Also deploy to Render manually
# Compare performance and decide
```

## 📈 **Cost Estimates:**

### **Railway Usage for Waitlist:**
- **Typical usage:** $1-3/month of the $5 credit
- **Heavy traffic:** $4-5/month of the $5 credit
- **Effectively free** for most waitlists

### **When You'll Need Paid Hosting:**
- **1000+ signups per day**
- **High traffic website**
- **Multiple applications**

For a waitlist, you'll likely stay within free tiers for months!

## 🎯 **Bottom Line:**

**Railway** is your best bet - the $5 monthly credit makes it effectively free for a waitlist, and you get professional-grade hosting without sleep issues.
